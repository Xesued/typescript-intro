Typescript Intro
==========
Simple repo that helps developers easy into Typescript 1.5


About Typescript
-----------------
Typescript is a superset to Javascript.  This means to start using Typescript, all you need to do is rename your
existing files from `.js` to `.ts`! JavaScript IS Typescript.

Typescript 1.5 supports much of the new ES6 standard and will be used in all of the examples in this document.  Also,
it implements some ES7 proposals such as decorators which we will touch on.

In a nutshell, Typescript is ES6 + some ES7 + types.


How to use this repo
------------------
All of the documentation is in the code.  In each subdirectory of `/src`, you will find examples and comments explaining 
the code.  Each of the directories focues on a particular aspect.
